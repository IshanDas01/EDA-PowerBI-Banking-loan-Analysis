# EDA-PowerBI-Banking-loan-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **risk analytics** for banking loans, utilizing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Visualization** to derive valuable insights. The goal is to analyze the factors influencing loan approvals and defaults, and provide actionable insights to minimize risks for financial institutions.

By leveraging tools like **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Python**, the analysis uncovers key patterns, trends, and risk factors that guide decision-making in the banking domain.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project include:
1. **Understanding Loan Risk Factors:** Identify key attributes influencing loan approvals and defaults.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the dataset for trends and anomalies.
3. **Data Visualization:** Create interactive dashboards for meaningful insights.
4. **Actionable Insights:** Provide recommendations to reduce loan risks.

---

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: For data extraction and querying.
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive data visualizations and dashboards.

## Data Overview
The dataset contains banking loan data with the following key features:
- **Customer Information**: Age, Gender, Income, Employment Status, etc.
- **Loan Details**: Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, etc.
- **Risk Indicators**: Default Status, Credit Score, Debt-to-Income Ratio, etc.

---

## Methodology
### 1. Data Collection and Cleaning
- Collected loan-related data from a banking dataset.
- Learned how to connect Mysql with python.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data for analysis (handled missing values, removed outliers, etc.).

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the dataset using Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
- Identified key patterns, correlations, and trends in the data.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Designed interactive dashboards in **Power BI** to visualize:
  - Loan approval rates by customer demographics.
  - Distribution of loan defaults across risk indicators.
  - Key performance metrics for banking executives.

## Visualizations
The following visualizations were created in **Power BI**:
1. **Loan Approval Dashboard**:
   - Approval rates by gender, age group, and income levels.
2. **Default Risk Analysis**:
   - Heatmap showing default rates across different income and credit score ranges.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the use of **EDA** and **Data Visualization** to analyze and mitigate risks in the banking loan process. The insights derived from this analysis can help financial institutions optimize their loan approval strategies and reduce the likelihood of defaults.

Feel free to explore the repository and use the provided scripts and dashboards for further analysis!
